# Sehender Raum / Seeing Space
Catching up with newer research in image based rendering: A TLDR on how traditional computer graphics will change with neural rendering. And how it fits with computer vision, machine learning and capture hardware.

In the next years computer graphics will be disrupted by neural rendering on every level. Graphics/vision research has probably barley started, exciting times ...

 * TLDR: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hnLXteodgoYD5awQpj_6VCiGHh8c5EyJx5-ia629Chs/edit?usp=sharing">Nerf in 10 slides</a>

Why does it matter? It might be the biggest change change to graphics since the mid 80ies: We can now **render lightfields**, the holy grail of graphics. We know about light fields since **1936** but until 2.5 years ago they were just too expensive and impractical to create and render. You needed the camera on the picture below at least, now you render one from **30 frames of compressed video** from youtube and a gaming machine or the cloud...

Because my graphics card is a bit too old to train locally I am working on a google colab setup for **NVIDIA Instant Nerf**, 
so you can  try before buying a new one <a href="https://github.com/3a1b2c3/seeingSpace/wiki/NVIDIA-instant-Nerf-on-google-colab,-train-a-nerf-without-a-massive-gpu">Step by step</a>

I am very interested in "neural rendering" and love to hear from anybody in the field (https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrinschmid/)

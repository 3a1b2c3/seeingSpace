## Notes about capturing, rendering and digitally reconstruction the world
When I learned about (traditional) computer graphics I think i missed the big picture about how all the pieces connect with hardware, physics and machine learning aspects. 
It makes it harder to understand recent research and its meaning for the field.
A minimal framework how to think about graphics and how "traditional approach" fit with newer research like Nerfs.

### Rendering large scenes
##### 3D Tiles for game engines and web browser 
3D Tiles is an open specification for sharing, visualizing, fusing, and interacting with massive heterogenous 3D geospatial content across desktop, web, and mobile applications.

### Beyond traditional computer graphics and capture technology

#### Plenoptic function and camera, light fields

#### Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) 

### 3d scene reconstruction and inverse rendering

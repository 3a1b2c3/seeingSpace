##  Sehender Raum / Seeing Space
# Notes about capturing, rendering and digitally reconstruction the world
When I learned about computer graphics I think i missed the big picture about how all the pieces connect and what is possible. 
Some notes on how they do. 

None of theses ideas are new or specifically my idea but its a useful framework to think about graphics and how "traditional approach" fit with newer research like Nerfs.

## Rendering the world as tiles
# 3D Tiles

## Beyond traditional graphics and capture techology
# Plenoptic function and camera
# Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)

# Sehender Raum / Seeing Space
Catching up with newer research in image based rendering: A TLDR on how traditional computer graphics fits with computer vision, machine learning and capture hardware.

Moved to the <a href="https://github.com/3a1b2c3/seeingSpace/wiki/Sehender-Raum-:-Seeing-Space">WIKI</a> of this repo.

Why does it matter? **We can now render lightfields**, the holy grail of graphics.
We know about lightfields since 1936 but until 2.5 years ago it was just to expensive and impractical.
You needed the camera on the picture at least, now you need 30 frames of compressed mp4 from youtube ...

Because my graphics card is a bit too old to train locally I am working on a google colab setup for **NVIDIA Instant Nerf**, 
so you can  try before buying a new one <a href="https://github.com/3a1b2c3/seeingSpace/wiki/NVIDIA-instant-Nerf-on-google-colab,-train-a-nerf-without-a-massive-gpu">Step by step</a>

I am very interested in "neural rendering" and love to hear from anybody in the field (https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrinschmid/)

# Sehender Raum / Seeing Space
Catching up with newer research in image based rendering: A TLDR on how traditional computer graphics fits with computer vision, machine learning and capture hardware.

Moved to the <a href="https://github.com/3a1b2c3/seeingSpace/wiki/Sehender-Raum-:-Seeing-Space">WIKI</a> of this repo.
Why does it matter? **We can now render lightfields**: It's a bit like bringing quantum computing to gaming PCs.




Because my graphics card is a bit too old to train locally I am working on a google colab setup for **NVIDIA Instant Nerf**, 
so you can  try before buying a new one <a href="https://github.com/3a1b2c3/seeingSpace/wiki/NVIDIA-instant-Nerf-on-google-colab,-train-a-nerf-without-a-massive-gpu">Step by step</a>

I am very interested in "neural rendering" and love to hear from anybody in the field (https://www.linkedin.com/in/katrinschmid/)
